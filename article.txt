The California Department of Justice on Wednesday released the warrant and
affidavit of a criminal investigation of the Wells Fargo bank. The State of
California served the warrant on October 5 to search the San Francisco
headquarters of Wells Fargo for felonious activities related to identity theft.

The warrant said property to be seized at the bank's San Francisco headquarters
was related to the unauthorized creation of accounts by Wells Fargo employees
including the names of individuals for the accounts; account information and
fees; the names of employees and their managers who created accounts without
the consent of the Wells Fargo customers in question; and all communications
including emails referencing the unauthorised accounts.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris's criminal probe is part of an
increasing list of officials nationwide questioning the business practices of
Wells Fargo such as California State Treasurer John Chiang who announced a
one-year suspension of State investment with the bank on September 28; Illinois
State Treasurer Mike Frerichs followed suit with a year-long ban on October 3;
and Democratic United States Senators Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Jeff Merkley
of Oregon, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who wrote to the U.S.
Security Exchanges Commission (SEC) suggesting investigation on September 29.
